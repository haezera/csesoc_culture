29/05/2024 20:21:46,,1st year,Government selective,FALSE,7,9,7,"Although I have made plenty of friends solely through uni, most of my closest friendships began back in high school. I would say programs during high school that let you meet people from other schools have been the most valuable in putting me in the social situation I'm in today, since a lot of people I've come across at uni have been friends of friends. This is also probably because I'm in first year and I haven't had much chance to get really close with anyone I met at the beginning of uni yet. To make friends in uni, I came in with an open mind, excited to meet new people because I was growing sick of being around the same kinds of people for 6 years. I joined society subcoms, attended almost all of their social events, showed up to my labs and started up conversations with people sitting next to me in lectures. I found that most of the time people appreciate that you initiate the conversation because everyone wants to make new friends, but they're too nervous to start the convo. "
30/05/2024 00:47:15,,2nd year,Government selective,TRUE,5,7,9,"Almost all of my friends from high school are at UNSW doing the same (or a similar) degree. Most ended up doing CompSci/Actuarial/Engineering (or double degree combinations of these). So, when I came to university, there was never any incentive for me to 'socialise' with new people. I didn’t go to any camps, join any societies or even go to university events. We all just kinda stayed in our bubble - this holds true for the grade above us from our High School too. I know this because we saw them still hanging out with their same friends from High School around campus lol.  On one hand this was cool because I never felt isolated as some people do when starting off at uni. I think a lot of this stems from the fact that - People are inherently different. Every time you go out and try to talk to someone new, more likely than not; they are going to be from a different background, have different interests, aspirations and values from you. You will not always like these people, and that’s okay! Eventually you do find people you can get along with.   But your friends from high school, you grow up with. These are people you already have tight bonds with and can trust. These people usually know your family, live close to you and will continue to be a big part of your life.  On the other hand, looking back at my first year, I regret not trying to meet new people. I think it’s important to go out and see how other people view the world, even if they end up being ‘weird’ a lot of the time lmaoo."
30/05/2024 15:03:45,,2nd year,Government non-selective,FALSE,10,8,8,"My experience is that in high school I was closer with a smaller group of people whereas at uni I know a lot more people but the connections aren’t as deep. I think it’s a lot easier to make surface level connections with people but it’s difficult to form what would be “groups” like in high school. I feel like this is partially bc many people come into uni with a pre-existing group and once any sort of group is formed it’s virtually impossible to become part of it. So while I feel like I’ve met a wide range of really interesting people at uni, it can sometimes feel awkward when I want to do something bc I don’t have a defined group of people to ask. So it has its pros and cons. But I’m glad I came to uni with none of my hs friends as i know I would have avoided meeting new people whereas now I have been forced to put myself out there which has been beneficial in meeting new people and growing as a person.

This was really the main way I was able to make great connections. Also I think if you like someone and would like to get to know them better in class asking for their socials is a good starting point to potentially also becoming friends. So society was definitely the way I was able to build such great connections.

As a first year, I was very fortunate to have friends and peers from my selective high school that also ended up doing computer science and being in subcom with those friends also helped me be more confident in making other friends in cse because I wasn’t completely alone. I think in uni, joining subcoms and opportunities allowing for constant meetup with the same people is really important especially since it’s so hard to see familiar faces when changing classes so often - but of course some subcoms do come with some nepotism (e.g. if you came from the same school might be a bit biased, etc) but yeah these are my few cents on this topic :) hope this helps!!"

With particular reference to UNSW CSE society, I believe there’s an invisible barrier with the preformed friendship groups - whether from high schools or connections formed in first year,  that causes difficulties for others to enter. I feel a lot of it is attributed to people having existing relationships which they would prefer to prioritise over investing in new ones."

My semi-dissatisfaction with my social situation is most likely due to my own issues rather than being caused by my social environment at UNSW / UNSW CSE / UNSW CSESoc. It is not relevant to this topic.  My semi-satisfaction mostly comes from my involvement in MSoc subcom. I am happy with the experiences I have due to this role, which are mainly internal bonding events like roadtrips and port and cross port activities. Attending and meeting people at external society events also played a huge role in my current position and satisfaction.  The main factor that led here was my previous awareness of UNSW society culture. My family friend convinced me to go BITSA first year camp when uni started, which is why I first started getting involved in their external events. I also had friends I knew through highschool volleyball, family friends and uni friends in some societies, which made me a lot more comfortable going to their external society events. Through these I could meet and become known by people who were involved in societies. My MSoc director also happened to be my FYC camp leader, and I had also already met two of the people in my port at FYC a year prior, as well as during several external BITSA events. It wasn't really a surprise since many MSoc people are ex-BITSA. Having old friends who are involved in societies played a major role in my social satisfaction."
